   * Generic OpenGL planar formats.
   *
   * This depends on the following extensions:
   * - EXT_texture_rg
   * - OES_texture_npot (GLESv2), or ARB_texture_non_power_of_two (GL)
   *
   * The naming convention separates planes by '_' and within each
   * plane, the order of R, G, B, A, Y, U and V indicates how those
   * components map to the rgba value returned by the sampler. X
   * indicates that the corresponding component in the rgba value is
   * not used.
   *
   * For example, RENDER_FMT_Y_UV means:
   * - texture[0].r = 'Y' component
   * - texture[1].r = 'U' component
   * - texture[1].g = 'V' component
